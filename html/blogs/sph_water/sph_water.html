		I remember playing this mobile game when I was younger called <i>Where's My Water</i> in which you have to solve physics
		based puzzles to give water to a crocodile so they can take a shower. The part that stood out to me was the actual water, 
		and I always wondered how they did it. Recently, I came across 
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSKMYc1CQHE">this video</a> by Sebastian Lague, and the water he makes
		looks strangely like the water in the game, so I decided to give it a shot and reproduce it. I also took this as an 
		opportunity to learn about compute shaders in OpenGL. 
		</p>

		<h2 id = "WaterParticlePhysics">Water Particle Physics</h2>
		<p>
		The technique I'm using to simulate my water is something called <i>Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics</i>, or SPH for short. 
		The idea is that we can view our water as a collection of particles that are subject to forces such as pressure, viscosity,
		and external forces like gravity.
		</p>
		
		<figure>

		<h3>Smoothing Function</h3>
		<p>
		In order to sample the density at some location within our fluid, we want to use what's called a smoothing function. This 
		function will allow us to weight the densities of particles depending on their distance to the sample point; the closer a 
		particle is to the sample point, the more it should contribute to the density. Since we want to be able to control the 
		blurriness of the output, we'll also define a radius, called the smoothing radius, at which if a particle is outside of
		this radius, it's contribution will be 0. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		For the purpose of sampling the density, I'll use the function $max(0, S - r)^3$, where $S$ is the smoothing radius and $r$
		is the distance.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		However, we've just created a problem; if we change the smoothing radius, the density of a point should only get more
		'smooth', but in reality, it will increase rapidly. To fix this, we can divide the result of the smoothing function by
		the volume of the smoothing kernel to 'normalize' the result. Finding the volume of the smoothing kernel as a function 
		of the smoothing radius just requires evaluating the following integral:
		</p>
		
		<figure>
			<p>$$\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{S}r*f(r) dr d\theta$$</p>
		</figure>
		
		<p>
		Where $f(r)$ is just the smoothing function. Evaluating the integral when $f(r) = max(0, S - r)^3$ gives us 
		$V(S) = \frac{\pi S^5}{10}$.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Pressure Force</h3>
		<p>
		The pressure force is accounted for by the term $-\nabla p$, which just means that each 
		particle will move in the direction of the negative pressure gradient. 
		To compute pressure, it's useful to first define a target density, the idea being that if a particle is above the target 
		density, we say that it is in positive pressure, and if it is below the target density, it is in negative pressure, and 
		a particle will always want to move towards the direction of 0 pressure. Setting a target density allows our fluid to 
		behave more like a fluid, as opposed to behaving like a gas, where the target density is near 0.
		</p>
		
		<pre><code class="language-java">
private float calculatePressure(float density) {
	float densityError = density - targetDensity;
	float pressure = densityError * pressureMultiplier;
	return pressure;
}
		</code></pre>
		
		<p>
		When applying pressure forces onto particles, we should keep in mind newton's third law; for every action, there is an equal
		and opposite reaction. For us, this means that the pressure forces applied between two particles should sum to 0. To make sure
		this happens, we can compute shared pressure, which is just the average pressure between two particles, and use this value
		to compute the pressure force. 
		</p>
		
		<pre><code class="language-java">
private float calculateSharedPressure(float d1, float d2) {
	float p1 = this.calculatePressure(d1);
	float p2 = this.calculatePressure(d2);
	return (p1 + p2) / 2.0f;
}
		</code></pre>
		
		<p>
		The direction of the pressure force should be pointed towards the negative gradient of the density field at the particle 
		location. To compute the gradient of the density field, we can just compute the gradient of the density kernel for every 
		particle around it, and sum them up. 
		</p>
		
		<pre><code class="language-java">
private float densitySmoothingKernelSlope(float dist) {
	return -3.0f * Math.pow(Math.max(0, smoothingRadius - dist), 2) * waterMass;
}

private Vec2 calculatePressureForce(int ind) {
	Vec2 pos = this.waterPositions[ind];
	Vec2 pressureForce = new Vec2(0, 0);
	for(int i = 0; i &lt nrParticles; i++){
		if(i == ind){
			continue;
		}
		float dist = pos.distance(this.waterPositions[i]);
		Vec2 dir = pos.sub(this.waterPositions[i]);
		dir.normalize();
		float densitySlope = this.densitySmoothingKernelSlope(dist);
		float sharedPressure = this.calculateSharedPressure(this.waterDensities[ind], this.waterDensities[i]);
		pressureForce.addi(dir.mul(sharedPressure * densitySlope / this.waterDensities[ind]));
	}
	return pressureForce;
}
		</code></pre>
		
		<h3>Viscosity</h3>
		<p>
		Viscosity is the term $\mu\nabla^2\vec{V}$. Loosely interpreted, it represents a force in the direction of the 
		average particle velocity around the particle. $\mu$ is just a coefficient to set how viscous the fluid should be. The effect
		this has is to make the particle velocities in the fluid more uniform. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Computing the force due to viscosity is very similar to computing density at a location. However, I will use a slightly 
		different smoothing kernel, one that is more smooth when $r$ is close to 0; $(S^2 - r^2)^3$.
		</p>
		
		<h3>External Forces</h3>
		<p>
		Finally, $\rho\vec{g}$ represents any external forces acting upon the fluid, such as gravity or collisions with the bounding
		box. We just apply these forces sometime during the update loop and it should work. 
		</p>
		
		<h2 id = "SpatialHashing">Spatial Hashing</h2>
		<p>
		Now that we have our simulation done, let's do some optimizations. Currently, each particle will check against every other
		particle in order to compute attributes such as density, pressure force, or viscosity force. But notice that if the distance
		between two particles is greater than the smoothing radius, they have no effect on each other. Thus, if we can find a way
		to prevent particles from checking other particles that are outside of the smoothing radius, then we can drastically speed
		up our simulation. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The idea is to partition space into grid cells, each cell having width and height equal to the smoothing radius. This way, if
		a particle is inside some grid cell, then all of the particles that can possibly be within it's 
		smoothing radius have to be in the 9 surrounding grid cells. 
		</p>

		</figure>
		
		<p>
		Normally, we would just maintain one list per grid cell containing all the particles within it, and update it when the 
		particles move, but this method comes with a few limitations, namely being that the space that our particles can move around
		in is limited by the number of lists we have, and that expanding and shrinking lists is not very GPU friendly. Ideally, we 
		would want a way to do all of these spatial lookups in a single static array. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		We can bypass both limitations using the following method: For each particle, we find the coordinates of the grid cell that 
		it is in and compute a hash value in the range of 0 to the number of particles minus 1. Then, we sort all of the particles 
		based off of their hash value in ascending order. Finally, we compute an auxillary array that stores for each hash value, 
		the first index where a particle has that hash value, or -1 if no particle has the hash value. 
		</p>
		
		<pre><code class="language-java">
//example grid hash function
private int computeHash(int x, int y) {
	x += 403;
	y += 107;
	return Math.abs(x * 8443 + y * 251527 + 6037) % nrParticles;
}
		</code></pre>
		
		<p>
		Then, when computing something like density, we can just iterate through each of the 9 surrounding cells, and use the 
		auxillary array to quickly extract all of the particles that have the same hash value as the cell that we are currently 
		looking at. 
		</p>
		
		<pre><code class="language-java">
private int[] dx = new int[] {-1, -1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1};
private int[] dy = new int[] {-1, 0, 1, -1, 0, 1, -1, 0, 1};

private List&ltInteger&gt getAdjacent(Vec2 pos) {
	List&ltInteger&gt adj = new ArrayList&lt&gt();
	int hashX = (int) (pos.x / smoothingRadius);
	int hashY = (int) (pos.y / smoothingRadius);
	for(int i = 0; i &lt 9; i++){
		int nx = hashX + dx[i];
		int ny = hashY + dy[i];
		int nhash = this.computeHash(nx, ny);
		int startInd = this.hashStartInd[nhash];
		if(startInd == -1){
			continue;
		}
		for(int j = startInd; j < nrParticles; j++){
			if(this.hashes[j] != nhash) {
				break;
			}
			adj.add(j);
		}
	}
	return adj;
}

private Vec2 computeDensity(Vec2 pos) {
	float density = 0;
	float nearDensity = 0;
	ArrayList&ltInteger&gt adj = this.getAdjacent(pos);
	for(Integer i : adj){
		//add density
	}
	return new Vec2(density, nearDensity);
}
		</code></pre>
		
		<p>
		A disadvantage to this method is that if two grid cells have the same hash value, you might waste some time checking a far
		away grid cell. But that performance hit is ok as long as we can get this to run on a compute shader. 
		</p>
		
		<h2 id = "ComputeShader">Compute Shader</h2>
		<p>
		With just spatial hashing 
		implemented, I can support 1000 particles running at around 60fps. Since the force applied on each particle
		can be determined purely from looking at the positions and velocities of the other particles in the scene, this simulation is
		extremely well suited to being run on the GPU, which can potentially speed things up many times over. To do this, we can 
		make use of <i>Compute Shaders</i>, which are provided by OpenGL version 4.3.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Compute Space</h3>
		<p>
		Like how Fragment Shaders work in Screen Space, Compute Shaders work in Compute Space. 
		Work Groups are the smallest amount of compute operations that the host application can execute at a time. While the work
		group space is in 3 dimensions, (X, Y, Z), you can set the magnitude of any dimension to 1 to perform the computation in 
		2 or 1 dimensions. 
		</p>
		
		<figure>
			<img src="global_work_groups.png" width="70%">
			<figcaption>Image Source : <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Guest-Articles/2022/Compute-Shaders/Introduction">learnopengl.com</a></figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>
		During execution, the order in which each work group is executed will vary arbitrarily, and the order of execution should not 
		be depended on by the algorithm. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Each work group might contain multiple compute shader invocations. The amount of invocations depends on the local size of the 
		work group, which is also 3 dimensional. 
		</p>
		
		<figure>
			<img src="local_space_work_groups.png" width="70%">
			<figcaption>Image Source : <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Guest-Articles/2022/Compute-Shaders/Introduction">learnopengl.com</a></figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>
		For our purposes, I will set the work group space and local space to 1 dimension, since we are operating on a list of 
		particles, and each compute shader invocation will process 1 particle. 
		</p>
		
		<h3>Pipeline Overview</h3>
		<p>
		In order to convert this into a compute shader, we must first think about the order in which we do things, since some things
		depend on other things to already be done, for example; computing the pressure force requires that we have already computed
		the density for all the particles. I ended up settling on the following order:
		</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Update position with velocity, and do boundary collisions. Generate spatial hashes for the predicted positions.</li>
			<li>Sort particles based off of hash value and generate lookup tables.</li>
			<li>Compute density and viscosity force for each particle.</li>
			<li>Compute pressure and interaction forces, and apply pressure, interaction, and viscosity forces to all the particles.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>
		Ideally, we want the data to reside on the GPU, since transferring data between GPU and CPU is very slow. We can store the 
		data on the GPU by creating 1D textures to act as buffers, and to access the data in the shader, we can pass the textures in
		as an <code>imageID</code> uniform. To sample from a specific pixel using integer coordinates, we can use the 
		<code>imageLoad</code> method.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Setting up the Shader</h3>
		<p>
		Now, let's write the actual compute shader. I'll only cover the shader for the first step of the pipeline here, as they only
		differ in the actual stuff they are doing; the setup remains pretty much the same. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		First, comes all the setup stuff, like defining the local work group size, and defining some uniforms to be set externally.
		</p>
		
		<pre><code class="language-glsl">
#version 430 core

layout (local_size_x = 64, local_size_y = 1, local_size_z = 1) in;

layout(rgba32f, binding = 0) uniform image1D posvelTexture;
layout(rgba32f, binding = 1) uniform image1D predictedPosLUTTexture;

uniform float delta_time;
uniform float predict_delta_time;
uniform vec2 bounds_min;
uniform vec2 bounds_max;
uniform vec2 gravity;
uniform float boundary_damping;

uniform int nr_particles;
uniform float smoothing_radius;
uniform int LUT_P1;
uniform int LUT_P2;
uniform int LUT_P3;
uniform int LUT_P4;
uniform int LUT_P5;
		</code></pre>
		
		<p>
		Next, we define some functions that will be helpful when hashing the predicted positions.
		</p>
		
		<pre><code class="language-glsl">
int computeHash(int x, int y) {
	x += LUT_P4;
	y += LUT_P5;
	return abs(x * LUT_P1 + y * LUT_P2 + LUT_P3) % nr_particles;
}

int computeHash(vec2 pos) {
	int hash_x = int(pos.x / smoothing_radius);
	int hash_y = int(pos.y / smoothing_radius);
	return computeHash(hash_x, hash_y);
}	
		</code></pre>
		
		<p>
		Finally, we slap a main method onto it to actually do the computation. 
		</p>
		
		<pre><code class="language-glsl">
void main() {
	int texelCoord = int(gl_GlobalInvocationID.x);
	vec4 posvel = imageLoad(posvelTexture, texelCoord);
	vec2 pos = posvel.rg;
	vec2 vel = posvel.ba;
	
	//update position
	pos += vel * delta_time;
	
	//gravity
	vel += gravity * delta_time;
	
	//boundary collisions
	{
		if (pos.x < bounds_min.x) {
			pos.x = bounds_min.x;
			vel.x *= -boundary_damping;
		}
		if (pos.x > bounds_max.x) {
			pos.x = bounds_max.x;
			vel.x *= -boundary_damping;
		}
		if (pos.y < bounds_min.y) {
			pos.y = bounds_min.y;
			vel.y *= -boundary_damping;
		}
		if (pos.y > bounds_max.y) {
			pos.y = bounds_max.y;
			vel.y *= -boundary_damping;
		}
	}
	
	//compute predicted position
	vec2 predicted_pos = pos + vel * predict_delta_time;
	
	//compute hash based off of predicted position
	int hash = computeHash(predicted_pos);
	
	imageStore(posvelTexture, texelCoord, vec4(pos, vel));
	imageStore(predictedPosLUTTexture, texelCoord, vec4(predicted_pos, float(hash), 0.0));
}
		</code></pre>
		
		<p>
		And the shader is done! 
		</p>
		
		<h3>Executing the Shader</h3>
		<p>
		Executing the shader is as simple as first setting all the uniforms, and then doing this:
		</p>
		
		<pre><code class="language-java">
glDispatchCompute(COMPUTE_NR_PARTICLES / 64, 1, 1);
		</code></pre>
		
		<p>
		The three arguments just set the amount of work groups in the X, Y, and Z dimensions respectively, and 
		<code>COMPUTE_NR_PARTICLES</code> is just a variable representing the total amount of particles I'm simulating. 
		I divide by 64 because that's the local size of each work group. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Of course, since we are running this multiple times on the same buffer, we want to make sure that the previous computation
		is finished before we start a new one, so right after running the shader, we put a memory barrier so that no new shader 
		invocation can access the buffer memory before the current invocation is complete. 
		</p>
		
		<pre><code class="langugage-java">
glMemoryBarrier(GL_SHADER_IMAGE_ACCESS_BARRIER_BIT);
		</code></pre>
		
		<p>
		After converting the simulation into a compute shader, it can now handle 4000 particles at 60fps, a 4x increase in the number
		of particles! Since this is my first time working with compute shaders, there are probably a lot of improvements possible,
		such as adjusting the size of the work groups, or managing memory more efficiently, but I'm happy with the result for now. 
		</p>
		
		<h3>Density Field Rendering</h3>
		<p>
		As a bonus, instead of rendering the particles, we can just render the density field that is created by the particles. Using
		the spatial hash we created, we can use a fragment shader to efficiently sample the density at every point on the screen, 
		and if it exceeds the density threshold, we'll color the pixel blue. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Since all the particle positions and spatial hashes are already on the GPU, this is extremely efficient to do. 
		</p>
		
		<figure>
			<img src="density_field_rendering.png" width="70%">
			<figcaption>The light blue, as opposed to the dark blue, represents the region that is at least 25% as dense as the density threshold.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>
		The rendering in Where's my Water was much nicer, as it had a blur effect if the water was moving quickly, but I think I can 
		tackle that some other time.
