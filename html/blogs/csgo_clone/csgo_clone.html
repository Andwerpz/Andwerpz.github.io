		<p>A not so complete recreation of CSGO, as the only gamemode currently available is deathmatch. Hopefully I can
		develop this engine further to make better stuff in the future.</p>
		
		<h2 id="ScreenSpaceDecals">Screen Space Decals</h2>
		<p>I wanted decals for two very important things: bullet holes and blood splatters. They would both serve the gameplay, 
		the former telling you where your shots are landing, and the latter telling you if you hit your opponent. And since I had
		a deferred rendering pipeline, I decided that screen space decals would be the best choice.</p>
		
		<p>In a deferred rendering pipeline, when you draw an object, you don't draw the finished image to the screen directly, 
		instead you draw out information about the object to each pixel on the screen, stuff like color, position, and surface normal. 
		After that, you do a few passes over the information, such as lighting, to process it into the final image.</p>

		<p>While a traditional decal would construct a mesh conforming to the surface that it sits on, screen space decals take 
		advantage of the information in the position buffer to layer the decal on top of whatever was already drawn.</p>
		
		<h3>How do they work?</h3>
		<p>First, we need to re-shade the pixels that are part of the decal. To do this, we can simply make a box around the decal area.</p>
		
		<figure>
			<img src="decal_bounding_box.png" width="50%">
			<figcaption>It also sticks out behind the wall</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>The next step is to filter out the parts of the box that stick out of the wall, leaving only the part of the box that conforms
		to the wall. We can do this by checking for each shaded pixel whether or not it is inside the decal bounding box. Because checking 
		whether a point is inside an arbitrary rectangular prism is non-trivial, and we'll have to do this step later anyways, we can 
		invert the model matrix of the box and just check the point in the box's model space.</p>
		
		<figure>
			<img src="decal_filtered_bounding_box.png" width="50%">
		</figure>
		
		<p>Now since we want to actually draw a texture instead of a white rectangle, we can use the x-y coordinates of the pixels
		in the box's model space as the texture coordinates that we sample the decal texture with.</p>
		
		<figure>
			<img src="decal_rendered.png" width="50%">
		</figure>
		
		<h3>One Problem</h3>
		<p>Since we decide which pixels to re-shade using a bounding box, if the camera is too close, then backface culling will stop
		us from rendering the decal. To fix this, just use frontface culling if the camera intersects the box. The problem with this
		solution is that you can't do this with instanced rendering of decals because the culling direction has to be the same for all 
		instanced meshes.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h2 id="Multiplayer">Multiplayer</h2>
		<p>Implementing multiplayer was rather straightforward, but since this was my first time doing any networking in general, 
		I'll write it here anyways. This won't be a comprehensive explanation, just some thoughts on multiplayer and networking.</p>
		
		<p>In java, networking can be done with the <code>ServerSocket</code> and <code>Socket</code> classes. A <code>Socket</code> has a 
		<code>DataInputStream</code> and <code>DataOutputStream</code>, which function identically to input streams made from a file, except 
		the file only ends when the client disconnects from the server. Since the function that reads information from the input stream waits 
		until information is available, you need to designate a separate thread to listen to each client socket for updates, as doing it in 
		the same loop as writing information to the client will cause the tickspeed of the server to be proportional to the highest latency 
		of any client.</p>
		
		<p>The basic idea is that the host or the server has the 'true' state of the world, and it sends updates to the players or clients
		telling them where everything is, for example, all the positions of other players. Using the information received from the server, 
		the clients then can render the scene according to their delayed perspective of the world. Clients can also send updates to the server,
		letting it know that they moved, or fired their gun.</p>
		
		<h3>Issues</h3>
		
		<p>For this project, many things that should be double checked on the server, such as hit registration, and movement, aren't. This
		leads to a problem where players can deal damage to each other after they have died, because player A's bullet could still be in 
		transmission to the server, when the server processes that player A has died. To solve this, every time a player respawns, I 
		assign them with a new unique life id, and communicate it to the rest of the clients. Each bullet will be packaged with the life
		id of the person it originated from, and the person it hit. If the life ids don't match up with the current ids on the server, then
		that bullet is discarded.</p>
		
		<p>Still, this solution doesn't completely make the game fair. If Alice has a lower latency connection to the server than Bob, then 
		Alice will have an inherent advantage over Bob due to the fact that any updates that Alice sends to the server will be processed first. 
		For example, if they both shoot each other in the exact same moment, then Alice's bullet will be processed by the server first, 
		thus killing Bob before the server receives the update that he is shooting.</p>
		
		<p>Another issue is that the movement of other players isn't very smooth. The root of this problem is that the server only updates clients
		with the position of each player, and not the velocity. If the clients were supplied with velocity as well, then they could interpolate
		the position of other players in between of the updates they receive.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h2 id = "UserInterface">User Interface</h2>
		<p>Since I'm working with OpenGL, which is a 3D graphics library, we have to find a way to render 2D images onto the screen. 
		To do this, instead of rendering things with a perspective projection matrix, we can use an orthographic projection matrix. The
		main difference between the two is that objects farther away from the camera with a projection matrix will appear smaller, while
		it won't change with orthographic projection, perfect for rendering flat 2D images onto the screen. This also gives us control 
		over the layering of ui elements, as we just need to assign a larger z value to the items on top.</p>

		<h3>Text Rendering</h3>
		<p>Because LWJGL doesn't have native support for rendering text, I had to come up with my own solution. Using Java FX, you can write
		text to an image, which then you can use as a texture on a 2D quad to render to the screen using the 3D pipeline.</p>
		
		<p>Next, we have to figure out how to align the text. Fonts are defined using a baseline, which is the bottom of most characters, 
		and maximum ascent and descent, which is the top and bottom of all characters in the font. Because in many fonts, there are some
		characters that stick out much more than other characters, just using the maximum ascent and descent values don't work. Instead, we
		want to sample the height of the commonly used characters, and use that to align the text.</p>
		
		<figure>
			<img src="text_alignment.png" width=90%>
			<figcaption>Notice how the max ascent line, the top black horizontal line, is way above the sample text. The blue box is
			the generated bounding box for the sample text.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<h3>UI Element Alignment</h3>
		<p>The second problem is the dynamic alignment of ui elements. To solve this, I came up with a 2 step system, first generating a 
		reference coordinate, then aligning the element around the reference coordinate.</p>
		
		<figure>
			<img src="ui_alignment.png" width=90%>
		</figure>
		
		<p>Every time the window is resized, an update is triggered that first re-generates all of the framebuffers needed for rendering, 
		then re-aligns all ui elements according to the new window size.</p>
