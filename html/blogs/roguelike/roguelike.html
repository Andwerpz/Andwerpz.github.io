		<p>My second platformer project was great and all, but I felt like the idea of making a 2D bullet hell game with gravity was
		inherently flawed, since the bullet hell aspect didn't mesh at all with the gravity mechanic. There was probably a way to
		solve this in an interesting and creative way, but after a few months, I had gotten burnt out. The foundational structure
		of the game also wasn't too great; adding weapons and enemies was a pain, as well as importing the textures for said 
		weapons and enemies. </p>
		
		<p>Long story short, I had learned alot while working on Platformer 2, and I decided it would be a good idea to start with a 
		clean slate to try to put some things I learned to use. As I still wanted to make a bullet hell type game, I axed gravity 
		(Sorry, Newton), and decided to make a top down game instead, aptly named: Roguelike.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h2>Textures</h2>
		<p>One of the major things that bugged me while working on Platformer 2, was the look of the game, namely the textures. Although
		the ground in Platformer 2 looked ok, it couldn't really stand on its own without lighting, and for the player, I completely 
		gave up and just drew a placeholder rectangle over the environment hitbox. So the first thing to do was to make a player sprite. </p>

		</figure>
		
		<p>Since the game is going to be top down, relying on lighting to make the floor textures look good is not going to work, as the player is always 
		going to be able to see all of the floor at once. Thus I also made a few floor textures.</p>
		
		<!-- floor textures img -->

		</figure>
		
		<p>I made differently sized tiles to make the floor more varied as you walked across. As my maps still had array based storage, 
		tiling the floor with these textures was very easy. Putting it all together looked something like this: </p>

		<h2>Animations</h2>
		<p>Another thing I wanted to improve on was handling animations of players and enemies. Before, in every enemy class I had a mess of flags 
		and logic to determine which animation played. Obviously, this wasn't sustainable, and so I reinvented the wheel and came up with state-based 
		animations. </p>
		
		<p>Instead of flags, we can use a state variable to control the behaviour of enemies. Each state, such as Walking, Idle, and Attack, can have
		conditions to transition to other states, such as a timer, or random chance. And we can also use these states to know when to draw each animation.

			</figure>
		</div>
		
		<p>The upside to handling enemy behaviour with states is that different enemies become quite similar to program; they each can move, and attack, 
		and be idle. This meant that I could throw out all the spaghetti I had rotting in my fridge, and I didn't need to write as much boilerplate code 
		as I had to before. We also get stuff like animation handling for free, and the code for drawing the animation was completely reusable from enemy 
		to enemy. In fact, I could even reuse the code for drawing enemy animations to draw the coins spinning on the ground.</p>
		
		<h2>Map Generation</h2>
		<p>Initially, I wanted to create an "Enter the Gungeon" style map, with differently shaped rooms, winding hallways, and secret doors. 
		But after a few days of development, I had to face the fact that I simply didn't have enough experience with map generation to 
		construct such a system, nor did I have the time to design lots of different rooms to make the map varied enough. So instead, 
		I opted to have perfectly square rooms aligned to a grid, and focus on the gameplay progression of each level first. </p>
		
		<p>There would be a total of 4 types of rooms in each level, Spawn, Enemy, Reward, and Exit. I wanted the maps to satisfy a few requirements: </p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>There should only be one Start and Exit room. </li>
			<li>There must be a way to get from the Start room to the Exit room.</li>
			<li>The player must have to travel through 2 Enemy rooms to get to the Exit room. </li>
			<li>Each Enemy room must be connected to a Reward room</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>The most straightforwards approach would be to place a Spawn room, then randomly traverse 2 rooms away from the spawn to be the Enemy rooms. Then 
		traverse one more room to be the Exit room. And that is pretty much exactly what I did. Onto each Enemy room, we can place an adjacent Reward room. And
		if somehow, there isn't any space to place a room, we can just scrap the map and try again. </p>
