		<p>Generating realistic looking terrain heightmaps with 2D noise functions, such as perlin or simplex noise is difficult. Of
		course there are wizards like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFld4EBO2RE">Inigo Quilez</a> that can generate fully 
		rendered terrain entirely within the fragment shader, but I'm
		looking for a more straightfowards approach. Although the usual method of perlin noise with fractal brownian 
		motion (fBm) may nicely approximate the general shape of realistic terrain, it lacks features such as sharp ridges and flat valleys 
		that make many mountainous regions look distinctive. It just so happens that both of these land features are formed in the 
		real world through hydraulic erosion, and so this is exactly what I want to simulate. </p>
		
		<h2 id = "GeneratingBaseTerrain">Generating Base Terrain</h2>
		<p>In order to erode terrain, we must first start with some terrain to begin with. As I mentioned before, perlin noise and fBm 
		is good for approximating the general shape of terrain, so we'll use this as our base terrain.</p>

		<p>If you want, you can also domain warp the base terrain, leading to interesting results:</p>

		<h2 id = "SimulatingErosion">Simulating Erosion</h2>
		<p>Now, all we have to do is to simulate the erosion. The plan is to drop thousands of water droplets onto the terrain, and
		depending on the slope of the terrain, the droplet will either pick up sediment; reducing the height at the given location, or
		will deposit some fraction of its sediment; increasing the height. Then, the water droplet will gain velocity in the direction
		of the current gradient, and the position will be updated according to the current velocity. If the velocity ever goes below 
		some threshold, the water droplet will be terminated.</p>

private static void performSnowballErosion(float[][][] heightmap) {
	float epsilon = 0.01f;
	
	float erosionRate = 1.5f;
	float depositionRate = 0.5f;

	float friction = 0.7f;
	float speedMult = 1;

	float x = (float) (Math.random() * TERRAIN_RESOLUTION);
	float y = (float) (Math.random() * TERRAIN_RESOLUTION);
	x = MathUtils.clamp(1, TERRAIN_RESOLUTION - 1, x);
	y = MathUtils.clamp(1, TERRAIN_RESOLUTION - 1, y);

	//previous x, y
	float px = x;
	float py = y;

	//the amount of carried sediment

	int maxIterations = TERRAIN_RESOLUTION;

	for (int i = 0; i < maxIterations; i++) {
		//get surface normal of terrain 
		Vec3 surfaceNormal = sampleNormal(heightmap, x, y);

		//if surface normal is flat, then we can stop
		if (Math.abs(1.0 - surfaceNormal.y) <= epsilon) {
			break;
		}

		//first, calculate erosion amt
		float erosionAmt = (1 - surfaceNormal.y) * sedimentErosionRate;
		float pSedimentAmt = sampleHeight(heightmap, px, py);

		//can't erode previous location to a lower height than the current one
		float heightDiff = sampleHeight(heightmap, px, py) - sampleHeight(heightmap, x, y);
		erosionAmt = Math.min(heightDiff, erosionAmt);
		
		//next, calculate what we deposit
		float depositCoeff = surfaceNormal.y;

		//make sure that we can't deposit sediment on steep slopes
		if (depositCoeff < 0.3) {
			depositCoeff = 0;
		}

		float deposit = carriedSediment * depositionRate * depositCoeff;

		//update the heightmap
		incrementHeight(heightmap, px, py, deposit - erosionAmt);

		carriedSediment += erosionAmt - deposit;

		//finally, update position of the droplet
		vx = friction * vx + (surfaceNormal.x) * speedMult;
		vy = friction * vy + (surfaceNormal.z) * speedMult;
		px = x;
		py = y;
		x += vx;
		y += vy;

		//we fell off the edge

			break;
		}
	}
}

		<p>We don't have to be too accurate when finding the normal at a point in the terrain; I just clamped the coordinates to 
		the nearest integer, and 
		sampled the normal there. To compute the normal, I just created 4 triangles from the neighboring cells of the heightmap, 
		and averaged the normals of those 4 triangles.</p>
		
		<!-- Terrain with normal lines -->
		<pre><code>
//create 4 triangles and average to sample normal
private static Vec3 sampleNormal(float[][][] heightmap, float x, float z) {
	int r = MathUtils.clamp(1, TERRAIN_RESOLUTION - 2, Math.round(x));
	int c = MathUtils.clamp(1, TERRAIN_RESOLUTION - 2, Math.round(z));

	Vec3 center = new Vec3(r, sampleHeight(heightmap, r, c), c);
	Vec3 up = center.sub(new Vec3(r - 1, sampleHeight(heightmap, r - 1, c), c));
	Vec3 down = center.sub(new Vec3(r + 1, sampleHeight(heightmap, r + 1, c), c));
	Vec3 left = center.sub(new Vec3(r, sampleHeight(heightmap, r, c - 1), c - 1));
	Vec3 right = center.sub(new Vec3(r, sampleHeight(heightmap, r, c + 1), c + 1));

	Vec3 normal = new Vec3(0);
	normal.addi(left.cross(up));
	normal.addi(down.cross(left));
	normal.addi(right.cross(down));
	normal.addi(up.cross(right));

	normal.normalize();

	return normal;
}

		<p>After the erosion simulation is done, the terrain looks much more convincing. Paths that droplets commonly take form divots
		and valleys are flat due to sediment being constantly deposited. It is worth noting that in order to get
		here, we didn't need any complicated maths, just a little intuition and guessing as to how erosion works.</p>

		<h3>Layered Terrain</h3>
		<p>This terrain looks kind of boring though, as it's only made up of 1 material. In the real world, terrain usually is made
		up of layers, with lighter sediment such as dirt and loose stones near the top, and heavier stuff like bedrock deeper down.</p>
		
		<p>Let's try to make our simulation handle two layers of material, the top layer being analagous to dirt, and the bottom one being
		more like stone. Now, instead of storing just 1 height per (x, z) coordinate in our heightmap, we can store both the height
		of stone, and the height of dirt at each (x, z) coordinate. </p>
		
		<p>The routine for handling the erosion amount of a water droplet also changes; eroding stone should be harder than eroding dirt, so
		an erosion coefficient should be set based on the material that we are eroding.</p>
		
		<!-- 2 Layer erosion code snippet -->
		<pre><code>
//first, calculate erosion amt
float sedimentErosion = (1 - surfaceNormal.y) * sedimentErosionRate;
float solidErosion = 0;
float pSedimentAmt = sampleSediment(heightmap, px, py);

//factor in eroding solid layer
if (sedimentErosion > pSedimentAmt) {
	sedimentErosion = pSedimentAmt;
	solidErosion = (1 - pSedimentAmt / sedimentErosionRate) * solidErosionRate;
}

//can't erode previous location to a lower height than the current one
float heightDiff = sampleHeight(heightmap, px, py) - sampleHeight(heightmap, x, y);
sedimentErosion = Math.min(heightDiff, sedimentErosion);
heightDiff -= sedimentErosion;
solidErosion = Math.min(heightDiff, solidErosion);
		</code></pre>
		
		<p>Now, if we have two types of materials we can't just color the entire terrain model one color anymore; the colors need to
		reflect which material is on top in the heightmap. My solution was just to blend between the dirt and stone color if the dirt
		height was below a certain threshold, or just use the dirt color if it's above.</p>

		<p>Of course, there's stuff that can be added or improved upon, I'll list a few ideas here:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Slope based terrain coloring</li>
			<li>Arbitrary amount of different types of sediment</li>
			<li>Trees to help lock sediment in place</li>
			<li>Wind to push sediment around</li>
			<li>Water droplets pool to form rivers and lakes</li>
			<li>Do erosion in compute shader for realtime eroding</li>
