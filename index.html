			<h2>3D Engine 2</h2>
			<p>A redone version of my first 3D engine. Framerates have been drastically improved upon, and support for texturing has been added. A file explorer option has also been added
			so you can load your own 3D meshes. If textures are desired, then you must place the .mtl and .png files in the same directory as the .obj file. There is no support for n-gons, 
			so that means that all polygons in your .obj must be triangles.</p>

			<h2>Space Balls</h2>
			<p>An homage to one of the greatest spinoffs of all time: Space Balls! Control the Eagle 5, and observe the magnificent space balls! The balls come with physics based collision and gravity as well.
			In reality, this is just a 3D graphics test. The application is just a simple rasterizer, but unlike the previous one, camera controls have finally been added. </p>

			<p><small>August, 2021</small></p>
			<h2>ML Digit Recognition</h2>
			<p>My first foray into the world of machine learning! For this project, I used the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. A fully connected neural network was used, and I managed to train an example network
			up to 90% accuracy on the testing data. I also included settings so you can generate your own neural network and train it. PSA: You will see a blank screen when you launch, don't worry, it's just 
			loading all the test cases.</p>

			<h2>Sphere Marcher</h2>
			<p>Not a ray marcher, but a full fledged ray tracer with proper lighting and shadows. The engine can handle spheres - hence the name - and triangle meshes, although as the object count grows,
			the program will become much slower.</p>

			<h2>Tetris Clone</h2>
			<p>A simple clone of tetris. The mechanics are as faithful to the original as I could get it, some fancy spin maneuvers might not be possible though. The program will make a new file to save
			your highscore, but it won't break the program to delete the file ... or edit your highscore.</p>

			<h2>Pathfinding Sketch</h2>
			<p>Either make your own maze, or let an algorithm make it for you, and then compare the two pathfinding algorithms, bfs search or astar, to see the pros and cons of each.
			Path cost is measured as the amount of cells travelled through to get to the destination, and as the pathfinding algorithm only checks in the four cardinal directions, 
			it's pretty much manhattan distance.</p>

			<p><small>June, 2021</small></p>
			<h2>Boids</h2>
			<p>A 2D simulation of birds flocking. Could also be applied to shoaling fish, or any other group animal. The math can also very easily be transferred to the third
			dimension, but I lack the knowledge to render it, and i'm too lazy to figure it out. This is also my first sketch in p5js!</p>

			<p>A small raycaster demo. Fog effects were added in order to help see the walls more clearly. There are a lot of projection issues though, might fix that later.</p>
