			<h2>Boids</h2>
			<p>A 2D simulation of birds flocking. Could also be applied to shoaling fish, or any other group animal. The math can also very easily be transferred to the third
			dimension, but I lack the knowledge to render it, and i'm too lazy to figure it out. This is also my first sketch in p5js!</p>
