	<p><b>Big thanks to the Coding Train. His video on the subject really allowed me to understand how to put this all together.</b><br><br>
	This demonstration is based on the <a href = "http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/" target = "_blank">boids algorithm by Craig Reynolds.</a> Each boid is simulated independently,
	and they can only "see" other boids within a certain range of themselves. Every boid has three rules on how to act, given the situation around them. They must first align themselves
	to the average direction of travel of their neighbors. Second, they must accelerate to the average position of their neighbors, and finally, they must steer to avoid getting too
	close to them as well. These three simple rules create a rather convincing simulation of birds flocking. </p>
