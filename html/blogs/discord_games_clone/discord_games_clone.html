		<h2 id="Intro">Intro</h2>
		<p>If you use discord, then chances are that you've noticed the minigames that you can start when in a server voice channel. 
		The problem is that most of the games require Discord Nitro, a paid subscription, and I'm broke. Thus, a scheme was born to get
		free Discord Nitro minigames through just making my own versions of them. </p>
		
		<p>In this here blog, I will go through the games in order of creation, and who knows, I might add some more on at a later date. 
		Also, here is the <a href="https://github.com/Andwerpz/DiscordGamesClone">link</a> to the github repo if you'd like to try it out
		yourself.</p>
		
		<p>As a side note, I did have alot of fun learning photoshop thru creating the splash screens for each game. Graphic design is
		now my passion.</p>

		<p>This is pretty much normal chess; you can make games to 1v1 your friends, and spectate the games that are currently going on. 
		There are some comfort features implemented such as tile highlighting for previous moves, and indicator dots telling you where the 
		legal moves are. Not much can go wrong when making a chess clone.</p>
		
		<h2 id="Scrabble">Letter League</h2>
		
		<figure>
			<img src="letter_league_v1.png" width="90%">
		</figure>
		
		<p>The one main issue I had with Letter League is that you couldn't have a custom word bank, so I solved that by just making it from
		scratch. I mean, there's not really much else to say other than that this is just normal scrabble. </p>
		
		<details>

			<p>I did add a brute force solver that automatically plays the best move point wise. 
			To activate, just press 'C' when it is your turn.</p>
		</details>
		
		<h2 id="BlazingEights">Blazing Eights</h2>
		
		<figure>

		<p>From the wikipedia entry on Crazy Eights, I learned that it was a "shedding-type" card game, so I just made an UNO clone for this
		one. The deck used for this game is the normal french suited set of playing cards, plus some special wildcards brought over from UNO.
		Normal UNO rules apply; each person must play a card that matches the suit or value of the previous card played, except if a wildcard
		is played, then any card is acceptable to play. There is also a 1 in 1000 chance to draw the elusive +200 card, which if played, turns
		the receiving player's screen into a wall of cards. </p>
		
		<p>During the development of this game, I also finally implemented a UI element nesting system, where nested UI elements have their
		transformations modified by multiplying their transformation matrix with their parent's matrix. This allows for me to not just slide 
		UI elements around in the x and y axis, but also rotate, shrink, enlarge; pretty much do anything I want with them.</p>
		
		<h2 id="CrackHeads">Sketch Heads</h2>
		
		<figure>
			<img src="crack_heads_final.png" width="90%">
		</figure>
		
		<p>One person is given a words to draw, and everyone else tries to guess the word they are trying to draw. Points are awarded based on 
		how quickly each person can guess the word. Optionally, you can consume "crack" to get a point multiplier; the downside being that crack
		makes it harder to guess the word. Level 1 changes the color of the lines, level 2 changes the shape, and level 3 sabotages the hints
		from other players thru the chat, and the hint bar at the top of the screen. 
		
		<h2 id="RocketLeague">Bobble League</h2>
		
		<figure>

		<p>Players first form into teams. Then, everyone decides on the magnitude and direction of force they want to impart upon their pegs. 
		Once the time runs out, all of the impulses are applied simultaneously, and time moves forward until all the pegs stop. The goal for both
		teams is to knock the peg with the ball on it into the other teams goal.</p>
		
		<p>To aid in the effort, players can collect peg toppers. Different peg toppers have different amounts of mass associated with them;
		the heavier ones having slower movement, but having more inertia, and the lighter ones having quick movement, but being easy to knock
		away. </p>
		
		<p>Physics calculations are all done server side. I'm pretty proud of the physics engine for this game; it's a 2D physics engine with 
		support for circles and convex polygons, and of course you can make concave polygons by combining two or more convex ones. It is also capable
		of doing plausible friction and angular velocity calculations, stuff that was missing from my previous iterations of physics engines.</p>
