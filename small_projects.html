			<h2>Chess Minimax AI</h2>
			<p>Two player chess, with a 3 move minimax chess AI on button click. Currently, the function evaluating the fitness of every 
			move is very rudimentary, only factoring in piece values, and their positions, closer to the center the better. Is best
			in the midgame, ok at the early game, and absolutely garbage at endgame. Only alpha beta pruning is implemented, no other
			optimizations.</p>

			<h2>Shadow Caster</h2>
			<p>While working on a 2D top down game, I thought it woud be cool if I could implement a line-of-sight mechanic. 
			The one I had at the time was really slow, only being able to handle 10 or so objects before the framerate dropped.</p>

			<h2>3D Ray Marcher</h2>
			<p>My first try at raytracing. Using the ray-marching technique I practiced previously, I did some simple graphics. 
			It's really slow, and only supports spheres, so it could definitely use some work.</p>

			<h2>Polygon Raycaster</h2>
			<p>After completing my first raycasting project, I wanted to break out of the limitations of a grid cell environment. 
			So, I turned to raymarching to solve the ray-polygon intersection problem.</p>

			<h2>Chaos Game</h2>
			<p>Yet another small project inspired by a numberphile video. This one was inspired by 
			<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs" target="_blank">Chaos Game</a>. I thought that it was 
			fascinating that such simple rules could make such complex shapes.</p>

			<h2>Darts</h2>
			<p>Inspired by <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_yU9eJ0NxA" target="_blank">Darts in Higher Dimensions</a>. The video poses an
			interesting probablity question, and I thought it would be interesting to solve it using a simulation.</p>
