		<p>My second platformer project was great and all, but I felt like the idea of making a 2D bullet hell game with gravity was
		inherently flawed, since the bullet hell aspect didn't mesh at all with the gravity meschanic. There was probably a way to
		solve this in an interesting and creative way, but after a few months, I had gotten burnt out. The foundational structure
		of the game also wasn't too great; adding weapons and enemies was a pain, as well as importing the textures for said 
		weapons and enemies. </p>
		
		<p>Long story short, I had learned alot while working on Platformer 2, and I decided it would be a good idea to start with a 
		clean slate to try to put some things I learned to use. As I still wanted to make a bullet hell type game, I axed gravity 
		(Sorry, Newton), and decided to make a top down game instead, aptly named: Roguelike.</p>

		<h2>Textures</h2>
		<p>One of the major things that bugged me while working on Platformer 2, was the look of the game, namely the textures. Although
		the ground in Platformer 2 looked ok, they couldn't really stand on their own without lighting, and for the player, I completely 
		gave up and just drew a placeholder rectangle over the environment hitbox.
