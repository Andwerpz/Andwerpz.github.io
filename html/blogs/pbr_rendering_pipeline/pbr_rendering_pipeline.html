		<p>PBR stands for Physically Based Rendering, which makes sense because this method of rendering aims to achieve greater
		photorealism than it's predecessor; Phong shading. It aims to do this by mimicing how light would behave in the real world, 
		while also being cheap enough to do in real time.</p>
		
		<p>I've implemented a deferred PBR rendering pipeline for my game engine, and I think it turned out pretty great. 
		In order to put this together, I followed the excellent tutorial by Joey de Vries over at 
		<a href="https://learnopengl.com/">learnopengl.com</a>. If you want to learn the theory and get implementation help, Joey's
		tutorial is the way to go; here, I will just write about some of the parts that I found interesting.</p>
		
		<h2 id = "RenderingEquation">Rendering Equation</h2>
		<p>The rendering equation describes the total amount of light being emitted from a point along a particular viewing direction. 
		The basis for this equation is the conservation of energy, the idea being that the total amount of emitted light from a point must
		not exceed the amount of light incident on that point. For PBR, we use a specific version of the rendering equation known as the
		reflectance equation.</p>
		
		<!-- reflectance equation -->
		<figure>
			<p>$$L_o(p,\omega_o)=\int_{\Omega}^{}f_r(p,\omega_i,\omega_o)L_i(p,\omega_i)n\cdot \omega_id\omega_i$$</p>
			<figcaption>Reflectance Equation</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>$L_o(p,\omega_o)$ represents the sum of reflected light from point $p$ in the direction $\omega_o$. Since light reflected from
		$p$ can come from any direction, we need to integrate across the entire hemisphere, $\Omega$.</p>
		
		<!-- Show image of hemisphere -->

		</figure>
		
		<p>Next, $L_i(p,\omega_i)$ is the amount of light incident on point $p$ from direction $\omega_i$. We scale this by the value 
		$n\cdot\omega_i$, which is just the cosine of the angle between $n$, the surface normal of $p$, and $\omega_i$. Finally, 
		$f_r(p,\omega_i,\omega_o)$ is the BRDF or bidrectional reflection distribution function. This function takes as input the incoming
		light direction $\omega_i$, the outgoing light direction $\omega_o$, the surface normal $n$, and some parameter to describe the 
		surface roughness $a$, and computes what fraction of light should be reflected. For example, if the surface is extremely smooth, 
		such as a mirror, the function would return $0$ for almost every $\omega_i$, except for the one that has the same reflected angle
		as $\omega_o$, in which case it would return $1$.</p>
		
		<p>When dealing with point and directional lights, we don't actually have to compute the entire integral; since these lights only
		come in from a specific direction, we can just compute the sum of contributions for all of the lights. But if you want illumination
		from the skybox, then you'll have to compute the integral since the skybox is a 3D surface.</p>
		
		<h3>BRDF</h3>
		<p>The most common BRDF used in PBR pipelines is the Cook-Torrance BRDF.</p>
		
		<figure>
			<p>$$f_r=k_df_{lambert}+k_sf_{cook-torrance}$$</p>
		</figure>
		
		<p>$k_d$ is the ratio of light that gets refracted, and $k_s$ (which should be equal to $1-k_d$ to satisfy the conservation of energy) 
		is the amount that gets reflected. $f_{lambert}$ is known as the Lambertian diffuse, which is a constant factor:</p>
		
		<figure>
			<p>$$f_{lambert}=\frac{c}{\pi}$$</p>
		</figure>
		
		<p>with $c$ being the surface albedo, and the divide by $\pi$ is there to normalize the diffuse light, as the integral is scaled by $\pi$.</p>
		
		<p>The specular portion, $f_{cook-torrance}$ is much more complicated:</p>
		
		<figure>
			<p>$$f_{cook-torrance}=\frac{DFG}{4(\omega_o\cdot n)(\omega_i\cdot n)}$$</p>
		</figure>
		
		<p>The numerator is 3 functions, and the denominator is just a normalization factor. The three functions are as follows:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>$D$, Normal <b>D</b>istribution Function: Approximates the amount of microfacets aligned to the halfway vector between $\omega_o$ 
				and $\omega_i$</li>
			<li>$F$, <b>F</b>resnel: Describes the ratio of surface reflection at different angles.</li>
			<li>$G$, <b>G</b>eometry Function: Describes the self shadowing property of microfacets.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>For each of these functions, there are many approximations out there that you can choose from, some more realistic, and some more efficient.
		I won't go over them here, as my understanding of them currently is not very good.</p>

		<h3>Ambient Lighting</h3>
		<p>When using IBL, ambient lighting is calculated by getting the amount of incoming light from the skybox, or environment map, that 
		hits the fragment surface, weighted by the cosine angle between the incoming light and the surface normal. This can be computed
		using a surface integral of a hemisphere. Note that we only really care about the surface normal of the fragment, as the environment
		map stays constant regardless of the position.</p>
		
		<!-- Show hemisphere integral -->
		
		<p>Obviously, this integral is probably too slow to compute on the fly. Note that since the value of the integral is only 
		dependent on the direction of the fragment normal, we can precompute an irradiance cubemap to sample the integral value 
		when rendering.</p>
		
		<!-- Comparison of environment map vs irradiance map -->
		<figure>

		</figure>
		
		<p>The benefits of doing ambient lighting like this are most apparent when seeing how a model is lit using multiple different 
		environment maps. Ambient lighting based on an environment map like this really helps models 'fit in' with minimal to no need
		to tweak lighting values. </p>

		<h3>Specular Reflections</h3>
		<p>Specular reflections are done much like ambient lighting, except now we also have to account for the roughness of the
		surface. We can precompute a reflection map based on the environment map and use mipmaps to store the different convolution
		levels. In the shader, trilinear sampling is used to interpolate between different roughness levels. </p>
